== Java 9 and 10 Workshop Requirements

1) Bring your laptop

2) Install JDK 10 by your computer. You can download current version (JDK 10) here http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html

Be sure that *java* and *javac* commands are accessible on command prompt.

[source,bash]
----
java -version <1>

java version "10.0.1" 2018-04-17
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.3 (build 10.0.1+10)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.3 (build 10.0.1+10, mixed mode)
----

<1> Check java version
<2> Be sure you have 9+


We saw in the previous practices, some attendees checked `java -version` but not `javac -version`. Be sure that both print 9+ version.

3) Set JAVA_HOME system variable

Set JAVA_HOME system variable properly or use direct path where it is used. We use it in the generate-image scripts. It is also suggested to not have space in the jdk path like 'Program Files'.

3) Your favorite IDE

Intellij, Eclipse, Sublime++ or any that you are comfortable with it. Some examples includes maven projects, 



See you!
